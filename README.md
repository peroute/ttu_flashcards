## 📌 Inspiration  
Creating flashcards has always been one of the best ways to retain difficult concepts, but it’s also very time-consuming. This project was built during a hackathon to make studying easier and faster by automating flashcard creation with AI.  

## 🚀 What It Does  
- Users select a course and ask a question or provide a concept.  
- The app instantly generates structured, detailed flashcards using the **Gemini API**.  
- Flashcards are rendered in real time for a smoother study experience.  

## 🛠️ How It’s Built  
- **Frontend:** React (JavaScript)  
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API with prompt engineering  
- **Data Management:** JSON files for course information  

## ⚡ Features  
- Course-based flashcard generation  
- Real-time AI-powered responses  
- Clean JSON output for easy frontend rendering  
- Fully functional MVP delivered within hackathon timeframe  

## 🎯 Challenges  
- Connecting frontend and backend requests with JSON data.  
- Structuring Gemini API outputs into clean, usable JSON.  

## 🏆 Accomplishments  
- Successfully built and deployed a working MVP in a short timeframe.  
- Learned effective frontend–backend communication and prompt optimization.  

## 📚 What I Learned  
- Full-stack development with React + Flask.  
- Best practices for API integration and data handling.  
- How to deliver a functional AI-powered tool under hackathon pressure.
